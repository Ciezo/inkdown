# Inspiration 
This project is built with love and creativity. I spent time thinking of solutions on how I can do this with <b>Vanilla PHP</b> only. I wanted to challenge myself to see how much critical thinking and design I can achieve without the help of any frameworks. 


This project is solely built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PHP. I know it is a little crazy, but I had fun! ‚öôÔ∏èüòÇ

I believe that beauty and simplicity lies with just the bare and native languages. I wanted to have much more customizations and control with the source code, hence, I thought of building this project with the said languages only. 

The remote database is deployed in an app pipeline with Heroku. I used ClearDB MySQL for that to ensure that all tables are fetched and saved somewhere safe. 

That's all. I hope you can clone or fork this project to improve it upon yourselves.
